Females are usually constructed as visual objects who wait for male rescue and need to be protected, whereas men are portrayed with more power. Such depiction of females in games reflects underlying social ideas of dominance of male over female and themes of masculinity.

For Spencer, therefore, atheism, pantheism and theism alike, despite \"seeming to their adherents quite rational, turn out, when critically examined, to be literally unthinkable\" [REF].
