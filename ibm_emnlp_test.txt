This house believes social deprivation causes crime	crime and delinquency are a result of choice	"Clarke and Cornish (1985) posit that, ""..crime is purposive behavior designed to meet the offender’s commonplace needs for such things as money, status, sex, excitement, and that meeting these needs involves the making of (sometimes quite rudimentary) decisions and choices, constrained as they are by limits of time and ability and the availability of relevant information."" Thus, offenders make decisions that appear rational (to the offenders at least) to engage in specific criminal acts"	warrant

This house believes social deprivation causes crime	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	"This biological perspective, sometimes seen as racist and increasingly unpopular, was criticized by early 20th century scholars, including Frances Kellor, Johan Thorsten Sellin and William Du Bois, who argued that other circumstances, such as social and economic conditions, were the central factors which led to criminal behavior, regardless of race"	warrant
This house believes social deprivation causes crime	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	"According to conflict theorists such as Marvin Wolfgang, Hubert Blalock and William Chambliss, the disproportionate representation of racial minorities in crime statistics and in the prison population is the result of race- and class-motivated disparities in arrests, prosecutions and sentencing rather than differences in actual participation in criminal activity, an approach which has also been taken by proponents of critical race theory [REF"	warrant
This house believes social deprivation causes crime	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	"Strain theory, which is largely derived from the work of Robert K. Merton in the 1930s and 1940s, argues that social structures within society which lead to inequality and deprivation in segments of its population indirectly encourage those segments to commit crime. According to strain theory, differences in crime rates between races are the result of real differences in behavior, but to be understood as an attempt to alleviate either absolute or relative deprivation and adapt to the existing opportunity structure [REF"	warrant
This house believes social deprivation causes crime	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	"Social control theory, which is among the most popular theories in criminology,[REF] proposes that crime is most commonly perpetrated by individuals who lack strong bonds or connections with their social environment [REF]. Based upon Travis Hirschi's Causes of Delinquency (1969), social bonding theory pioneered the notion that criminologists can gain useful insight into the motives behind criminal behavior by examining what normally motivates individuals to refrain from crime. From this it is argued that, in those segments of the population where such motivation is lacking, crime will be more prevalent. Hirshi was explicit in mentioning that he believed his theory held true across all racial boundaries, and subsequent research - both in the US and abroad - seems to confirm this belief [REF"	warrant

This house believes social deprivation causes crime	"in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime"	"A more recent approach to strain theory was proposed by Steven F. Messner and Richard Rosenfeld in the 1990s. In their version of the theory, which they refer to as institutional anomie theory, Messner and Rosenfeld argue that the dominance of materialistic concerns and measurements of success manifested in the American Dream weakens the effectiveness of informal social control mechanisms and support processes, which encourages economic gain by any means, legal or illegal. In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, therefore, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation [REF"	warrant

This house believes social deprivation causes crime	crime is most commonly perpetrated by individuals who lack strong bonds or connections with their social environment	"Social disorganization theory proposes that high rates of crime are largely the result of a heterogeneous and impoverished social ecology [REF]. Proponents of the theory point to the process of urban decay as a major contributing factor to the breakdown of healthy urban communities which would normally curb the spread of many forms of criminal behavior. The diversity of minority cultures present in poverty-stricken neighborhoods prevents the formation of strong social bonds and leaves inhabitants uninterested in maintaining positive community relationships. This has been observed to increase the likelihood of crime in certain urban areas, which can lead to increased policing and a further breakdown of familial structures as a result of arrests, which, in turn, precipitates more crime"	warrant
This house believes social deprivation causes crime	a gap between people’s aspirations and their access to legitimate means of achieving them results in a breakdown of values	"Merton theorizes that anomie (normative breakdown) and some forms of deviant behavior derive largely from a disjunction between “culturally prescribed aspirations” of a society and “socially structured avenues for realizing those aspirations.

At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status [REF"	warrant
