Females are usually constructed as visual objects who wait for male rescue and need to be protected, whereas men are portrayed with more power. Such depiction of females in games reflects underlying social ideas of dominance of male over female and themes of masculinity. Although not all video games contain such stereotypes, there are enough to make it a general trait.

Analyzing these three hypotheses, however, Spencer finds that, \"differing so widely as they seem to do\", they all \"contain the same ultimate element. It is impossible to avoid making the assumption of self-existence somewhere\",[REF] whether with regard to a part of the universe (atheism), the universe as a whole (pantheism), or an external creator (theism). Furthermore, the idea of self-existence is not merely inescapable but \"rigorously inconceivable; and this holds true whatever be the nature of the object of which it is predicated\". For Spencer, therefore, atheism, pantheism and theism alike, despite \"seeming to their adherents quite rational, turn out, when critically examined, to be literally unthinkable\" [REF].

This theory has been explored by Ruby K. Payne in her book A Framework for Understanding Poverty. In this book she explains how there is a class system in the United States where there is a wealthy upper class, a middle class, and the working poor class. These classes each have their own set of rules and values which differ from each other. In order to understand the culture of poverty and how the poor class\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set of rules tend to keep them trapped in this continual cycle Payne describes these rules and how they affect the poor class. Time is something that is treated differently by the poor; they generally do not plan ahead but simply live in the moment which keeps them from saving money which will help their children escape poverty", "label": 0}
