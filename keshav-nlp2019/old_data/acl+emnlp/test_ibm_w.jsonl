Analyzing these three hypotheses, however, Spencer finds that, \"differing so widely as they seem to do\", they all \"contain the same ultimate element. It is impossible to avoid making the assumption of self-existence somewhere\",[REF] whether with regard to a part of the universe (atheism), the universe as a whole (pantheism), or an external creator (theism). Furthermore, the idea of self-existence is not merely inescapable but \"rigorously inconceivable; and this holds true whatever be the nature of the object of which it is predicated\". For Spencer, therefore, atheism, pantheism and theism alike, despite \"seeming to their adherents quite rational, turn out, when critically examined, to be literally unthinkable\" [REF].

After all, the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place, and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age. If that crime was a direct result of anti-Semitism taken to its logical end, then anti-Semitism itself, even when expressed in private conversation, is inevitably discredited among most people. What better way to rehabilitate anti-Semitism, make anti-Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti-Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened\u2014 indeed, that it was nothing more than a frame-up invented by the Jews, and propagated by them through their control of the media?
